## Challenge

* Create a **stack** class that creates an empty Stack with a `top` property when instantiated. Define the stack methods: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `isEmpty`.

### Included Tests

* Can successfully push onto a stack
* Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
* Can successfully pop off the stack
* Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
* Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
* Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
* Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
* Can successfully enqueue into a queue
* Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
* Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
* Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
* Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
* Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
* Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
